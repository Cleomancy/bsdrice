# RICE MY BSD
A port of my DWM config for FreeBSD

I use DWM and friends to make my pc look pretty, This is my preconfigured build

Everything has been configured to compile under FreeBSD 
You'll probably have to install some dependencies yourself ALSO you may want to change the keyboard layout in the .xinitrc


PREREQ. xorg-server, xinit, libxinerama, libxft, feh, unclutter, ttf-font-awesome ncurses pkgconf and a ttf of your choice I personally use hack-font but you can change that in the script (xbacklight for laptops)


Feel free to use it.
